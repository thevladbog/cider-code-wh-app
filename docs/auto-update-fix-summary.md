# ðŸš€ Auto-Update System Status Report

**Date:** June 11, 2025  
**Issue:** Auto-update system returning 404 errors  
**Status:** âœ… **RESOLVED**  

## Quick Summary

**Problem:** Application couldn't find `latest.yml` file in GitHub Releases, causing 404 error when checking for updates.

**Root Cause:** electron-updater expects a `latest.yml` metadata file that GitHub Releases doesn't generate automatically.

**Solution:** Created automated `latest.yml` generation and integrated it into CI/CD pipeline.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Created latest.yml Generator Script**
- `scripts/generate-latest-yml.cjs` - Automatically generates metadata file
- Includes SHA512 checksums, file sizes, and proper YAML format
- Integrated into npm scripts: `npm run generate-latest-yml`

### 2. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflows**
- `ci-cd.yml` - Added latest.yml generation for tag-based releases
- `release.yml` - Added latest.yml generation for branch-based releases
- Both workflows now upload latest.yml to GitHub Releases

### 3. **Enhanced Release Process**
- `release-build.cjs` - Now includes latest.yml generation
- Complete automation from build to release

## Testing Results

âœ… **Script runs successfully**  
âœ… **Generates proper YAML format**  
âœ… **Calculates SHA512 checksums**  
âœ… **Detects build artifacts automatically**  
âœ… **Integrates with existing workflows**  

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `scripts/generate-latest-yml.cjs`
- `updates/latest.yml`
- `docs/auto-update-latest-yml-fix-completion.md`

## Next Steps

1. **Test with actual release** - Create a release to verify the complete flow
2. **Monitor auto-updates** - Ensure users can successfully update
3. **Document for team** - Share solution with other developers

## Impact
