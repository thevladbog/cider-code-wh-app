# Serial Port Developer Documentation (Deprecated)

Serial/COM printer support has been removed from this application. Only network printers are supported. This document is retained for historical reference only.

## Overview

The application supports two types of printer connections:
- Network (TCP/IP)
- USB (Direct USB connection)

Serial/COM port connections are no longer supported.

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Print Configuration Interface**
   - Defined in `src/utils/print.ts`
   - Includes `connectionType: 'network' | 'usb'` properties

2. **Main Process Communication**
   - Implemented in `src/main.ts`
   - Handles the actual communication via Node.js

3. **Renderer Process Configuration UI**
   - Implemented in `src/components/PrinterSettings.tsx`
   - Provides UI for configuring printer settings

## Data Flow

1. User configures a printer in the UI
2. Configuration is saved to `printers.json` in the app's user data directory
3. When printing, the main process reads the configuration and sends data to the printer

## Key Functions and Methods

### Printing to Network Printer

```typescript
// In main.ts
const printToNetworkPrinter = (printer: PrinterConfig, zplData, resolve, reject) => {
  // Send data to printer over network
};
```

## Error Handling

Printer errors are handled at multiple levels:

1. **Connection Level**
   - Printer not found
   - Permission issues

2. **Communication Level**
   - Data transmission failures
   - Timeout errors

3. **UI Level**
   - User feedback for connection issues

## Dependencies

Printer functionality depends on:

## Best Practices for Development

1. **Resource Management**
   - Ensure proper handling of network resources

2. **Platform Compatibility**
   - Support different network configurations across platforms

## Testing Printer Features

For automated testing:
- Test network printer configuration and communication

Manual testing:
- Verify with different printer models
- Test error handling for connection issues

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Printer Not Found**
   - Symptom: Cannot connect to printer
   - Solution: Ensure the printer is powered on and connected to the network

2. **Access Denied**
   - Symptom: Permission error when trying to print
   - Solution: Check user permissions and printer sharing settings

3. **Data Transmission Issues**
   - Symptom: Incomplete or garbled printing
   - Solution: Check network stability and printer status

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements to the printer implementation:

1. Support for more printer-specific protocols
2. Better diagnostics for printer issues
3. Enhanced user interface for printer configuration
